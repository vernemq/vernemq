%% This module implements X-Forwarded-For support. Currently, only the X-Forwared-For header is supported.
%% X-Forwarded-For expects a list, as in X-Forwarded-For: <client>, <proxy1>, <proxy2>.
%% proxy2 is checked against the configured list of trusted proxies. The trust relationship between proxy2
%% and proxy1 has to be ensured by proxy2.
%%
%% Not supported at the moment (maybe later):
%% - x-forwarded-client-cert, for CNAME support
%% - Forwarded (RFC 7239)
