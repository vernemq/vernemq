    % vmq_message_store:stop is typically called when stopping the vmq_server
    % OTP application. As vmq_plugin_mgr:disable_plugin is likely stopping
    % another OTP application too we might block the OTP application
    % controller. Wrapping the disable_plugin in its own process would
    % enable to stop the involved applications. Moreover, because an
    % application:stop is actually a gen_server:call to the application
    % controller the order of application termination is still provided.
    % Nevertheless, this is of course only a workaround and the problem
    % needs to be addressed when reworking the plugin system.
