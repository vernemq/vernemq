%% vmq_reg_sync:
%% -------------
%% The goal of vmq_reg_sync is to offer a generic solution to synchronize
%% tasks in an Erlang cluster.
%% The task scheduling algorithm ensures (in a consistent cluster) the
%% following properties:
%%   1. For a specific task-type only one task runs at a time
%%   2. If a task owner dies it's running task is killed
%%   3. If a task owner dies it's queued tasks are removed and won't be exectuted
%%
%% How does it work:
%% ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
%% Every cluster node runs a vmq_reg_sync gen_server process as well as
%% a vmq_reg_sync_action_sup supervisor process.
%% A vmq_reg_sync:sync(SyncKey, Fun, Timeout) calculates (using hashing)
%% which node is responsible for the provided SyncKey. A remote gen_server
%% call enqueues the Fun into the queue for SyncKey. While the scheduling
%% may take place on a different node than the Caller noder, the Fun is, once
%% dequeued, run on the caller node by adding a child to the Caller local
%% vmq_reg_action_sync_sup.
