# Promises the VerneMQ Mission makes (Draft/RFC Status)

If it's not clear to you what a Promise is, here's an introduction to [Promise Theory](http://markburgess.org/promises.html).

In Promise Theory, what we do by issuing this file, is that we make the scope of the Promises public so that each agent can judge the Promises made and the outcome.
Also, note that Promises are not impositions (obligations).

## To Users of the VerneMQ Codebase, we promise:
- to treat you in a friendly, respectful and inclusive way (see also our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/vernemq/vernemq/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md))
- to answer selected questions on any Community channel and react to selected issues opened on Github, with a best-effort approach. 
- to ensure the conditions of the Apache 2 license for the source code on Github.

## To Users of the Binary Packages (requiring a paid subscription), we promise:
- to treat you in a friendly, respectful and inclusive way (see also our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/vernemq/vernemq/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md))
- to build and test a binary package for every tagged VerneMQ release. This might take some time, and we might decide to jump or retract a release if issues surface in open testing. 
- to build at least a .deb and a .rpm based package.
- to build at least 2 Docker images (currently Alpine and Buster-based).
- the hold any additional conditions of the subscription CLA (forwarded with subscription)

## To Contributors, we promise:
(Code or non-code contributors)
- to treat you in a friendly, respectful and inclusive way (see also our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/vernemq/vernemq/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)).
- to be appreciative of your time and effort, in general.
- to review your Pull Requests in a best-effort fashion.
- to keep your original PR/contribution attributed to you.
- to welcome and foster a discussion not only on code contributions but
active feature discussion etc.

## To Sponsors, we promise:
- to treat you in a friendly, respectful and inclusive way (see also our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/vernemq/vernemq/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md))
- to use the funds towards the improvement and maintenance of VerneMQ.
- to offer you the "perks" mentioned on the Github Sponsors Page.

## To Customers with a Support Agreement, we promise:
- to treat you in a friendly, respectful and inclusive way (see also our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/vernemq/vernemq/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md))
- to (of course) adhere to all the contractual obligations in the negotiated Support Agreement.

## To Upstream dependencies and their maintainers, we promise:
VerneMQ uses other open-source projects where this is the most natural thing to do and where the license of those projects permits it. Examples would be Cowboy (the HTTP server) and Hackney (the HTTP client).
We do realise that those upstream dependencies have maintainers who put in a lot of work to update and improve their libraries. We also realise that we need to do more in supporting those upstream maintainers.
We have not yet implemented a systematic approach to this, but here's the promises:

- to treat you in a friendly, respectful and inclusive way (see also our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/vernemq/vernemq/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md))
- to support selected open-source projects that are used in VerneMQ (by contributions and preferably financial support).
