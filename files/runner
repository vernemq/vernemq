Usage: $SCRIPT «command»
where «command» is one of the following:
    { help | start | stop | restart | ping | console | attach
      attach-direct | ertspath | chkconfig | escript | version | getpid
      config { generate | effective | describe VARIABLE } [-l debug]

cat <<EOF
Usage: $SCRIPT «command»
This is the primary script for controlling the $SCRIPT node.

 INFORMATIONAL COMMANDS
    help
        You are here.

 SERVICE CONTROL COMMANDS
    start
        Starts the $SCRIPT node in the background. If the node is already
        started, you will get the message "Node is already running!" If the
        node is not already running, no output will be given.

    stop
        Stops the running $SCRIPT node. Prints "ok" when successful.  When
        the node is already stopped or not responding, prints:
        "Node '$NAME_HOST' not responding to pings."

    restart
        Stops and then starts the running $SCRIPT node. Prints "ok"
        when successful.  When the node is already stopped or not
        responding, prints: "Node '$NAME_HOST' not responding to
        pings."

    console
        Starts the $SCRIPT node in the foreground, giving access to the Erlang
        shell and runtime messages. Prints "Node is already running - use
        '$SCRIPT attach' instead" when the node is running in the background.

 DIAGNOSTIC COMMANDS
    ping
        Checks that the $SCRIPT node is running. Prints "pong" when
        successful.  When the node is stopped or not responding, prints:
        "Node '$NAME_HOST' not responding to pings."

    attach
        Attaches to the console of a $SCRIPT node running in the background
        using an Erlang remote shell, giving access to the Erlang shell and
        runtime messages. Prints "Node did not respond to ping!" when the
        node cannot be reached.
        Exit \`$SCRIPT attach\` by pressing \"Ctrl-G q\".

    attach-direct
        Attaches to the console of a $SCRIPT node running in the background
        using a directly connected FIFO, giving access to the Erlang shell
        and runtime messages. Prints "Node did not respond to ping!" when the
        node cannot be reached.
        Exit \`$SCRIPT attach-direct\` by pressing \"Ctrl-D\".

    chkconfig
        Confirms whether the $SCRIPT.conf and advanced.config is
        valid.

        For applications configured with cuttlefish, this includes a call
        to \`config generate\` also.

    config { generate | effective | describe VARIABLE } [-l debug]
        prints configuration information for applications configured with
        cuttlefish enabled. \`-l debug\` outputs more information for
        troubleshooting.

        generate
            generates the app.config and vm.args files from the .conf file.
            This is effectively what happens before start, but you'll need
            to use \`config generate -l debug\` to see the cuttlefish debug
            output.

        effective
            prints out the effective configuration in cuttlefish syntax
            including defaults not specified in the .conf file. This is
            for 'start-time' configuration only.

        describe VARIABLE
            for a given setting, prints any documentation and other useful
            information, such as affected location in app.config, datatype
            of the value, default value, and effective value.


SCRIPTING COMMANDS
    ertspath
        Outputs the path to the $SCRIPT Erlang runtime environment

    escript
        Provides a means to call the \`escript\` application within the $SCRIPT
        Erlang runtime environment

    version
        Outputs the $SCRIPT version identifier

    getpid
        Outputs the process identifier for a currently running instance of
        $SCRIPT.
